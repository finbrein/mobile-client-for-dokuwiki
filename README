Welcome to Dokuwiki Mobile Client *********************************************************************************************************************IntroductionThis is a mobile client that allows a user to fetch Dokuwiki version via XML-RPC and output the result to the screen.It is a simple one-button app that fetches the version via the Titanium Mobile. The Mobile-Client-Capture shows the output after running the program and clicking on the widget button.The App folder contains the project demo including all the resources. Note that the current installation of DokuWIki is on my local machine. Therefore changes have to be done to make it run on another machine. The Android emulator is using IP address 10.0.0.2 for the local machine.My current effort is to understand the Synchronization Plugin and use it in managing synchonization. This is needed for offline browsing. I am also working towards ensuring that the app fetches Dokuwiki information via XMLRPC over HTTPS(Offline browsing) on Titanium Mobile.Getting Help**********************************************************************************************************************If you have a question or need help with Dokuwiki Mobile Client, you can get help from the following sources:* eMail: finbrein@gmail.com* IRC: irc://irc.freenode.net #dokuwiki (my nickname is finbrein)
